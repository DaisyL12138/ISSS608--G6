    "title": "Electricity Price Analysis in Europe: The Impact of the War between Russia and Ukraine",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nThe European electricity market is one of the largest and most complex in the world, with a diverse range of producers and consumers spread across multiple countries. The wholesale price of electricity in Europe is affected by various factors, including supply and demand, weather conditions, economic indicators, and geopolitical events.\nThe ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine is one of the most significant geopolitical events in recent years. This conflict has had far-reaching effects across Europe, including the electricity market. The two countries are significant players in the European energy market, with Russia being one of the largest suppliers of natural gas and Ukraine serving as a key transit country for gas supplies to Europe.\nThe conflict has caused disruptions to energy supplies, leading to price spikes and volatility in the European wholesale electricity market. It has also highlighted the importance of diversifying energy sources and reducing dependence on a small number of suppliers.\nIn this context, there is a need for analysis and forecasting of the European wholesale electricity market to understand the impact of the conflict and other factors on electricity prices. Time series forecasting can provide valuable insights into future trends and help businesses and consumers make informed decisions about their energy usage and investments.\nThis project aims to address this need by analyzing the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on electricity prices in Europe and conducting time series forecasting of wholesale electricity prices for all European countries. The results of this analysis and forecasting will be presented through various informative, visually appealing visualizations, which will help stakeholders in the European energy market make better-informed decisions about their energy usage and investments."

    "text": "Proposed Visualization\n\nRegional Insights\n\n\n\nLine chart\nThe line chart was used to visualize the price trend of selected countries over the period of Jan 2015 to Jan 2023. This method provided a clear picture of how electricity prices have evolved over time in different countries. By selecting a subset of countries for comparison, businesses and analysts can better understand the differences in electricity pricing across Europe, as well as the impact of specific events, policies, or other factors on prices.\nHeat Map\nThe heat map was used to show the relationship between different days in a week and different hours in a day. This method is useful for understanding the patterns and trends in electricity consumption over time. By analyzing the heat map, businesses and analysts can identify peak and off-peak periods of electricity consumption, which can inform decisions about pricing, capacity planning, and energy efficiency initiatives.\nPrice Comparison\nThe price comparison method was used to compare the prices for the same month across different years. This method provides a useful way to understand how electricity prices have changed over time and to identify patterns or trends in price movements. By comparing prices across different years, businesses and analysts can identify factors that have contributed to price changes, such as changes in the energy mix, shifts in demand patterns, or other external factors. This information can inform pricing strategies and energy procurement decisions.\n\n\n\nGeographic Visualisation\n\nThe geographic visualisation analysis used country location and price to create an interactive and dynamic visualization of electricity prices in Europe. The method involved using a colour-coded map of Europe, with each country’s price represented by a different colour or shade. The intensity of the colour or shade represented the depth of the price, with darker colours indicating higher prices.\nThe visualisation was presented in GIF format, which allowed the audience to view the price change smoothly over time. This provided a useful way to understand the fluctuations and trends in electricity prices across Europe. By visualizing the price changes in this way, businesses and analysts could quickly identify areas of high or low pricing, as well as the factors that contributed to price movements.\n\n\nTime Series Forecast\n\nThe Prohect and ARIMA models were used to forecast the electricity prices in Europe for a user-entered number of days. This method involved analyzing historical price data, identifying trends and patterns, and then using these insights to generate forecasts for future prices.\nThe results of the analysis were visualized using a line chart, which provided a clear and concise representation of the forecasted prices over time. By adjusting the number of days input by the user, businesses and analysts could generate forecasts for different time horizons, allowing for more informed decision-making and planning."

    "text": "Energy resources and demand are important factors in our daily lives and the global economy. The demand for energy is growing as the world’s population increases, but the increasing use of energy also contributes to global warming and climate change. The purpose of this project is to examine the energy resources and demand in different countries and regions over the past three years, with a focus on reducing carbon emissions. By analyzing energy generation patterns and identifying areas where changes can be made, we hope to raise awareness and motivate individuals, businesses, and governments to take action towards a more sustainable future."

This information can highlight areas where greater investment in renewable energy sources is needed.\nIt is observed from the monthly electricity data that there are two types of energy sources in general: import and generate, and in the method of generation, there are clean and fossil.\nSo that we have:\nNet import + total generation = Demand\nTotal generation = Clean + Fossil\nClean Energy = Renewable Energy + Nuclear Energy\n\n\nSkeleton\n\n\n\n\nProblem 2\n\nAnalysis\nThis sector would be focusing on CO2 emissions. It is planned to provide both a horizontal and a vertical comparison of CO2 emissions among various countries within the same geographic or political category, as well as the same country within a specific period. Upon monitoring the CO2 emissions, we will also observe what the correlations are between emissions and electricity indexes for each country with a heatmap.\n\n\nSkeleton\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 3\n\nAnalysis\nEnergy demand vs generation: It’s important to examine the gap between energy demand and generation in different countries and regions. This information can be used to inform infrastructure planning and investment decisions to meet growing energy needs in a sustainable way.\n\n\nSkeleton\n\n\n\n\nProblem 4\n\nAnalysis\nGeo map visualization: It is planned to visualize the previous three analyses on the Geo map, another heatmap layer will be applied on top of the map to give audiences a better understanding of the correlation between different countries and continents.\n\n\nSkeleton"
